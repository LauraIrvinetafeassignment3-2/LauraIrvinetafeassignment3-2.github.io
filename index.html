</h2>
<p class="auto-style2">Garden’s Fruit and Veg is a traditional store selling 
fruit and vegetables, along with other commodity items such as milk, soft 
drinks, sweets etc. Garden’s has been in business for 27 years and has a 
reputation for the quality of their goods. The proprietor, Mike Garden, has 
discovered that there are many people who, through work schedules and home 
lifestyles, don’t have the opportunity to shop in person. For convenience, they 
do their fruit and vegetable shopping at supermarkets, but are not happy with 
the quality of the produce from the supermarkets. Mike wants to tempt these 
customers back by taking his store to them, in their homes.
